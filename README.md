# permy

This package allows us to compute classical statistical tests between two samples, whether they are following a normal distribution or not, by using the permutation theory. The tests provided are the based on the t.test and var.test already computed in R. It is particularly useful in a sense that the assumption of the distribution is not made beforehand making it up for a the "var.test" performing an F-test which is more relevant for samples following a normal distribution.
